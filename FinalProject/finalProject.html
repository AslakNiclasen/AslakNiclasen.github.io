      <h2 id="subTitle">Exploring executions in the United States from 1977 - 2017</h2>
      <h3 class="subHeader">Motivation</h3>
      <p id="introParagraph">
        The following project is the final project of the course Interactive Data Exploration at Diku 2017/18. It has been a collaboration between Aslak Niclasen and Jonathan Kurish.<br> We've chosen a medium sized dataset which describes all executions performed in the United States from 1977 - 2017. This data is easily available from <a id="datasetOrigin">here</a> and can be downloaded as a .csv file.<br><br> Our motivation for choosing this particular dataset is straightforward. We have alot of information from each individual data-component. This gives us the ability to create a more enriching experience because the viewer has a lot of initial control. By doing so, we can smoothly guide and present aspects of the data, which <strong>we</strong> find interesting. Note the emphasis on we, since we don't which to tell every story possible, but rather enlighten the viewer from our starting point, and let further exploration take over. For the purpose of understanding we start our journey with two main aspects which we want to explore. Firstly: it's interesting to see if certain states are executing more convicted people than others - going further from here whats their race. This could be due to Federal laws in the United States being different from state to state. As an example, some states doens't have death penalties at all. Secondly: we wish to see if convicts whom killed more than 1 person is executed differently. That is, are we using a particular type of execution for multiple homocide convicts. With these questions in mind, we now describe dataset.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subHeader">The dataset</h3>
      <p id="dataExplanation">
        The dataset consists of 1467 individual rows each corresponding to an execution. Each execution is labeled with a set of distinct features of which the most important are listed below. Note that two rows in the dataset did not contain any Date of execution, and has therefore been discarded. Leaving us a total of 1465 executions.
        <ul id=dataFeatures>
          <li>Date of execution</li>
          <li>Name of the convicted</li>
          <li>Age</li>
          <li>Sex</li>
          <li>Race</li>
          <li>Number of victims | Their race | Their sex</li>
          <li>State of crime incident and execution</li>
          <li>Region of crime incident within state</li>
          <li>Race of victim(s)</li>
          <li>Type of execution</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 class="subHeader">Overview of all executions</h3>
      <p id="timeLineIntroParagraph">
        Following the introduction above we now present an overview of the entire dataset. Each execution is marked as a circle where the <span style="font-size: 30px">radius</span> of the circle represent the number of victims, and the <span style="color:red">co</span><span style="color:blue">l</span><span style="color:green">or</span> of the circle represent the Type of execution. Each circle can be hovered, which in return shows additional information on that execution. By adjusting the timeline slider below the graph it's possible for the viewer to see the recorded executions on a yearly basis. The full x-axis represents a single year from 01/01/yyyy - 31/12/yyyy. The y-axis marks the age of the convicted. If one wishes to see the entire 30 year period (all datapoints at the same time), it's possible to switch from a yearly view to a full view instead. If marked the slider is removed and the circles become unclickable due to occlusion of each other.

      <p id="histogramParagraph">
        Below is a histogram of each individual type of execution and it's total number of occurences. As seen (when hovering), the most dominant type is Lethal Injection with 1290 records, followed by Electrocution at 158, Gas Chamber at 11, closing at Hanging and Firing Squad both at 3. Thus Lethal Injections has been used about 8 times more than Electrocutions. This finding is important because it shows that certain types of executions are very rare. In fact, the very harsh types of execution (excluding Electrocution) account for only ~1.1%. It might again be due to US laws requiring the convicted should not suffer unnecessary during the execution. From the timeline view we can especially see that Lethal injections are dominating the later years, thus supporting this find. Further more this dataset only consist of data post 1977, which is why this may be a bit scewed. We would probably see a larger extend of hanging and firing squad in earlier years, where the Lethal Injection substances used weren't discovered at that time.

        In order analyze the data further, we need to visualize variables against each other. To do so we present a series of stacked barplots. As can be seen, the y-axis represent the total number of persons in each category of the x-axis. From the dropdown menue to the side the user is able to correlate a set of individual features against each other. The very first view is a scatterplot identical to the full view of the timeline. It is not possible to get back to this state again unless the page is reloaded. You could instead use the timeline plot as shown previously.

      <p id="conclusionParagraph">
        As seen from the timeline result, we find no correlation between the type of execution and the number of victims. This is perhaps not afterall surprising since the law in the U.S. demands that the convicted should suffer no more than the punishment itself. However some individual states work differently under a Federal law, and such sometimes chooses and appropriate type of execution based on their equipment. Which lead us into an answer to your second initial question. Are some states executing more than others? If we change the scatterplot to present the states as the x-axis, we can clearly see that some states and in particular Texas (TX) Executes more. <br><br>
        As a final conclusion we would like to point out that this dataset doesn't represent a very important factor. We haven't been able to find the timeframe for a convicted situated in prison. It is likely that many of the people executed between 1977 and 2017 have been sitting in jail for a long time. And so to understand the proces of executions, this factor might influence the conclusions we base our findings on. As an example, Timothy mcVeigh, whom killed 168 in the Oklahoma city bombing perfromed his attack in 1995, and was executed in 2001. However John Fergusson whom killed people in Miami in 1978, was executed in 2013. A reason for delay could be federal laws within each state, but statistics on death row time, compared to the convicted would be an interesting thing to look at.

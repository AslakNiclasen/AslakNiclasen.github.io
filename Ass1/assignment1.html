				<li>
					<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html">Company offerings</a>

				</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Respective explanations -->
			<p style="width:50%">
				<b>Company offerings:</b> The New York Times provides an illustration of company offerings, and their different values throughout a timescale. The development of facebook and it's impact is clearly illustrated as a very big circle. Multiple scales are possible which is very nice. It is a shame that to many smaller companies are bunched up (since the have similar offerings), so the information when hovering is hard to find if you want to find a specific company. Further more the colors doesn't seem to illustrate anything in particular.
			</p>
			
			<p style="width:50%">
				<b>Baby name popularity:</b> Baby name wizard has made a vizualisation about the number of named babies given a certain name. It depicts this relationship over a timescale, both for boys and girls. It's cool because it's easy as a user to manipulate the input, recieving different outcomes. It's quite a mess with the actual timescale. THe authors could instead have pinpointed exact years.

		<h2>Aslak would like to visualize:</h2>
		<h3 id=aslak> <!-- Aslaks thoughts here -->
			<ol style="padding-top: 26px">
				<li>
					I would like to visualize twitter retweets over a small timescale, in order to see how many people can be reached i a global setting.
				</li>
				<li>
					I don't know if there is any data available, but one could perhaps scrape twitter to find out.
				</li>
				<li>
					The intended audience could be companies wanting to know how different social platforms can be used for marketing. This is of course a thought example since most companies already does this.
				</li>
				<li>
					Im thinking a main person as a bubble with name, and then all retweets from that person. But linked transitively outwards, if a retweet of a retweeter is done.
				</li>
